This is the 3d printer firmware I imaged my Ender 3 Pro with.

The code for this is not originally my own. I started with the base marlin 2.0 firmware that can de found at this link https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin. I then enabled bed leveling and the z offset wizzard. I also used a caliper to measure the offsets for the fan duct that I printed.
